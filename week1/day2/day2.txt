Looping Statements:

for Statement: The for loop in Java is used to iterate over a range of values or to 
repeat a block of code a certain number of times. It consists of three parts: 
initialization, condition, and iteration expression. The loop continues as long as the condition is true.

Example:

for(initialization;condition;iteration){

}
i++ -> post increment => i+1
++i -> pre increment
                
for (int i = 0; i <5; i++) {
   syso(i)
   //i++= i+1
   }
  i=0;0<5;0+1 =>1
  i=1;1<5;1+1 =>2
  i=2;2<5;2+1 =>3
  i=3;3<5;3+1 =>4
  i=4;4<5;4+1 =>5
  i=5;5<5=> loop will be stop
}

output :

for(int i=5;i>0;i--){

i=5,5>0;5-1 =>4
i=4;4>0;4-1 =>3
i=3;3>0;3-1 =>2
i=2;2>0;2-1 =>1
i=1;1>0;1-1 =>0stop loop






Jump Statements:

break Statement: The break statement is used to exit a loop prematurely. When encountered inside a loop,
 it immediately terminates the loop, and the control is transferred to the statement following the loop.

 for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  //0,1,2,3,4,5
    if (i == 5) {
        break; // Exits the loop when i is 5
    }
    // Code inside the loop
}


continue Statement: The continue statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for 
the current iteration and move on to the next iteration.

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if (i == 5) {
        continue; // Skips the rest of the code for i=5 and continues with the next iteration
    }
    // Code inside the loop
}
//0,1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9


Method:

*A method in Java is a collection of statements that perform a specific task. Methods are defined 
within classes and are used to organize code, make it reusable, and promote modular programming.

*A method typically consists of a method signature, which includes the method name, return type,
 and parameter list, and a method body, which contains the code to be executed when the method is called.

Return Type: Specifies the type of data the method will return, or "void" if it doesn't return anything.
 Parameters: Input values passed to the method for processing.

//normal method
public void data(){
}

//main method
public  static void main(String[] args){

}

Accessmodifier -public
static - common reference
void-return type
main-method name
String[] agrs- input arguments

Accesmodifier,returntype,methodName,input arguments


Normal method:

Accesmodifier returntype methodname(input arguments){
    
}

Example:
public class MyClass {
    // Method definition -> UPI
    public void printMessage() {
       syso("hello");
    }

    // Method with parameters and return type -> Cash 
    public int addNumbers(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public String name(String value){
        return value;
    }
}



 Object:

An object in Java is an instance of a class. A class is a blueprint or a template that defines the 
structure and behavior of objects. Objects are created based on these class definitions.
variables ,methods

Objects have attributes (fields or properties) and behaviors (methods). The attributes represent
 the state of the object, and the methods define the actions or operations that the object can perform.

syntax:
step 1:
ClassName objectName=new ClassName();

step 2:

objectName.methodName();



 Arrays:
 An array in Java is a data structure that allows you to store multiple values of
 the same data type under a single variable name. Arrays provide a way to efficiently
 manage and access a collection of elements of the same type. Each element in an 
 array is identified by an index, starting from 0 for the first element.

 Example: int[] myArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

array will be work on index value -start from '0'

char[] data ={'a','d','g','c','e','s'}
starting index -0
ending index -5

 store all 575 names String={"a","b","c"}
 String[] name={"","",""}

 
 String[] name={"             "}
